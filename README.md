### predator-prey-simulation
# A Lotka-Volterra model written in Java that describes predator-prey relationships

The Lotka-Volterra model depends on six parameters: 
* the population of prey
* the population of predator
* prey birth rate
* prey death rate
* predator birth rate
* prey birth rate

The model can be described by the following two equations which use the parameters stated above:

D(prey population)dt=prey birth rate prey population - prey death rate prey population predator population 

D(predator population)dt=predator birth rate predator pop. prey pop. - predator death rate  predator pop.
